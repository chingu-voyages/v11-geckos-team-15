### Features

#### Basic Overview of Features

A single page web app which allows for a job search that pulls from multiple job APIs and/or web crawlers. This is done by identifying search input parameters which are shared amongst various APIs, and also results values which are shared. The results are then displayed in a uniform way based on information which is common to all APIs.

#### Core MVP Features List

1. A search form to input keywords and location

1. A results page which lists results from multiple APIs in a uniform way - results are paginated, 10 results at a time.

1. A button to add 10 more results to the page or call the APIs again if needed.

1. A job result preview component which will be used to show a summary of the job and link to the full job posting.

1. Each job post will have an 'add' button to add to saved jobs.

1. Each post in 'Saved jobs' will have a 'Remove' button.
