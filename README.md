### Features

#### Basic Overview of Features

A single page web app which allows for a job search that pulls from multiple open job APIs. This is done by identifying search input parameters which are shared amongst various APIs, and also results values which are shared. The results are then displayed in a uniform way based on information which is common to all APIs.

#### Core MVP Features List

1. A search form with multiple input parameters which are shared amongst all used APIs. (Location, salary, industry, etc.)

1. Option to select which APIs will be included in the search.

1. A results page which lists results from multiple APIs in a uniform way - results should be paginated, 20 results at a time - button at bottom to load more results

1. A job result preview component which will be used for the results page should include summary of the job, should also be a logo next to the result indicating which API it came from. Should be clickable and lead to the original posting on the website of the source API.

1. Search results should filter when criteria from the search input parameters are changec (I.e., if salary range is narrowed, those jobs results should be cut out.)

#### Extra Features

1. Live search suggestions
